# Workday-Scheduler

# Introduction

The purpose of this task was to create a working day calendar, which held the information which was input. This data would be held in local storage. Once this time had past the the row would become grey to show that the time had past, red when the time was the present time and the time of the future should be shown in green. On top of this it should show the current working day’s date on top of the calendar.



#### For the future

For the future I would like to incorporate what I have learnt when using Jquery. Whether it be the use of the various libraries available or showing that I am cable of understanding what is being done, but most importantly bringing it all together with the HTML and CSS. As this is what makes a site look average, to great. I’m still not as comfortable as I like to be with it, as there’s a long way to go, but I’m confident that I will get there!
